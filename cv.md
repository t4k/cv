## Work Experience

### Digital Technologies Development Librarian

*California Institute of Technology* — November 2015 to Present

Latest Projects & Activities:

- Migrated library.caltech.edu to a new platform with extensive customization. Wrote all Sass/CSS and JavaScript to overcome platform limitations. Developed an automated deployment system with GitHub Actions, Playwright, and custom Python scripts. See [github.com/caltechlibrary/libguine](github.com/caltechlibrary/libguine) for more. Wrote a web scraper for tracking changes to content due to lack of revisions in the CMS. See [github.com/caltechlibrary/overtime](github.com/caltechlibrary/overtime) for more.
- Developing an automated digital preservation workflow to allow archivists to send files to multiple systems with the push of a button. Using Python, it calls the ArchivesSpace API for reading and writing archival object metadata, the Boto3 AWS SDK for Python for uploading files, custom scripts to interact with a tape server, and Drush (and the REST API) with Islandora 7 to publish access files. (Repository is currently private, but I am willing to selectively share with interested parties at this point.)
- Serving on the Library Accessibility Committee and leading the Digital Spaces sub-group.
- Deployed a serverless IIIF application to support our online course reserves system. Developed conversion scripts for scanned book images to be compatible with IIIF and the Universal Viewer. See [github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs](github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs) and [github.com/caltechlibrary/dibsiiif](github.com/caltechlibrary/dibsiiif) for more.
- Instructor with the Library Software & Data Carpentry Team which includes teaching workshops on Git, Python, and Shell regularly.
- Custom work with Caltech Archives & Special Collections to manipulate and migrate data between different types of records in ArchivesSpace, using Python.
- Served on the CORAL Steering committee and contributed PHP code to the project. See [github.com/coral-erm](github.com/coral-erm) for more.

### Freelance Developer

*Our Glass Elevator / Film Powered* — April 2015 to October 2021

- Solo developer for all features and requests for a mutual teaching network site for women in the film industry.
- With Drupal 7, extensive site building and customization modules were used to create a credit system, registration waitlist queues, job boards, and more.
- Registration conditions were extremely complex so as to filter out those who did not meet requirements. Examples of the complexitiy include layered conditionly exposed fields that determine a user roles, and an multi-view administrative dashboard for manually approving users who made it past the first step.
- Extensive automated testing using Behat.

### Senior Developer / Lead Trainer

*The Cherry Hill Company* — January 2014 to November 2015

- Contributed to LibrarySite and LibraryDAMS, which are projects that aimed to be turn-key sites and digital asset management systems for libraries using Drupal 7 and Islandora.
- Primary liason between clients and developers.
- Presented and led trainings at many conferences and camps.
