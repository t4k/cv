## Work Experience

### Digital Technologies Development Librarian

*California Institute of Technology* — November 2015 to Present

Selected Projects & Activities:

- Co-managed a pilot project to rapidly photograph the Grubbs papers in order to analyze their contents with AI and machine learning tools.
- Built a custom web interface for digital collections material using Python scripts, AWS S3, the ArchivesSpace API, and AWS Lambda to present IIIF images.
- Created a GitHub Actions–based workflow for enabling Archivists to edit and publish oral histories transcripts using Markdown into a dynamic web interface that replaces static PDF files.
- Developed an automated digital preservation workflow to allow archivists to send files and metadata to multiple systems with the push of a button. It uses Python, the ArchivesSpace API for reading and writing archival object metadata, and the Boto3 AWS SDK for Python for uploading files. The UI is currently being rewritten to leverage GitHub Issues and GitHub Actions for reduced code maintenance.
- Deployed a serverless IIIF application to support our online course reserves system. Developed conversion scripts for scanned book images to be compatible with IIIF and the Universal Viewer. See [github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs](github.com/caltechlibrary/dibs) and [github.com/caltechlibrary/dibsiiif](github.com/caltechlibrary/dibsiiif) for more.

- Migrated library.caltech.edu to a new platform with extensive customization. Wrote all Sass/CSS and JavaScript to overcome platform limitations. Developed an automated deployment system with GitHub Actions, Playwright, and custom Python scripts. See [github.com/caltechlibrary/libguine](github.com/caltechlibrary/libguine) for more. Wrote a web scraper for tracking changes to content due to lack of revisions in the CMS. See [github.com/caltechlibrary/overtime](github.com/caltechlibrary/overtime) for more.
